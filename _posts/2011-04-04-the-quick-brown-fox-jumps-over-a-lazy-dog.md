We had our first meeting with our mentor this week and talked a lot about determining the direction of the design.

> At this point we preliminarily determined that we needed to make a task about automatic cleaning cars

**The automatic cleaning car** is mainly used to clean the garbage in the stadium, which is used to reduce the high cost of artificial production.
## Introduction
The automatic stand-cleaning cart is an intelligent cleaning device designed for large venues. Its purpose is to reduce manual labor and improve cleaning efficiency, especially in environments like stadiums and theaters with large areas and multiple tiers. This cart features autonomous navigation capabilities, allowing it to avoid obstacles and ensure high-coverage cleaning of the entire stand area.

**Key Features**:

1. **Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance**: Equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors, the cart can autonomously detect obstacles and plan the optimal cleaning path to avoid collisions or getting stuck in narrow areas.

2. **Efficient Cleaning System**: The cart is fitted with rotating brushes and a vacuum system, effectively cleaning dust, litter, food scraps, and various types of debris, which are collected in an onboard dust container for easy disposal.

3. **Lightweight and Durable Structure**: The frame is made of aluminum alloy, which is lightweight and corrosion-resistant, making it suitable for long-term use outdoors and in different weather conditions.

4. **Long-lasting Battery Life**: A lithium-ion battery powers the cart, allowing for extended cleaning sessions on a single charge. Additionally, a solar panel provides supplementary power, further extending battery life.

5. **Intelligent Control System**: The cart features a microcontroller-based control system, enabling autonomous movement and multiple cleaning modes. Users can also monitor the cart's status in real-time and manually intervene via remote control if necessary.

**Applications**:

The automatic stand-cleaning cart is ideal for various venues, stadiums, and open-air theaters that require regular cleaning. It improves cleaning efficiency, saves labor, and addresses potential safety issues associated with traditional manual cleaning, such as steep steps or high-altitude positions.

**Advantages**:

- **Labor Savings**: Compared to traditional manual cleaning methods, the automatic cleaning cart can independently perform tasks, reducing the need for cleaning staff.
- **Efficient Cleaning**: The optimized path planning and coverage algorithm ensure high cleaning coverage of the area, minimizing missed spots.
- **High Flexibility**: Thanks to precise sensing capabilities, the cart can adapt to environmental changes. Whether it is navigating through tight spaces between fixed seats or avoiding sudden obstacles, it can adjust accordingly.

The automatic stand-cleaning cart represents an intelligent solution with significant potential for reducing cleaning costs and enhancing venue maintenance efficiency.
