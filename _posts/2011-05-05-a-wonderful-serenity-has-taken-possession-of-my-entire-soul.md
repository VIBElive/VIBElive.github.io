### Background and motivation
With the development of society, labor costs rise, the cost of traditional mechanical cleaning methods is higher, and manual cleaning efficiency is lower, especially in places such as stadiums. The development of autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology provides technical support for the development of autonomous clean vehicles. The aim of developing automated grandstand cleaning vehicles is to improve cleaning efficiency, reduce costs and improve the working environment for sanitation workers through automation technology, while reducing safety risks.

### Constraints and goals
## Cost and time constraints
The development and manufacture of autonomous cleaning vehicles needs to be cost-effective to ensure a reasonable return on investment.
- The cost should be controlled within about 1500 RMB and the time should be controlled within one year.

## Technical requirements
- ** Autonomous Driving technology **: Advanced sensors, positioning systems and algorithms need to be integrated to achieve autonomous driving.
- ** Cleaning efficiency **: Meet the cleaning needs of different environments.
- ** Safety **: Ensure timely identification and avoidance of obstacles during automatic driving.

## Applicability
- Self-cleaning vehicles should be suitable for all environments, especially stadiums.

## Goals and metrics
- Improve operational efficiency and reduce manpower requirements through automatic cleaning.

### Technical project plan overview
## Material
- ** Frame **: Aluminum alloy (light weight, corrosion resistance, stable structure).
- ** Brush **: Nylon or polypropylene brush (durable, effective cleaning of different surfaces).
- ** Motor **: DC gear motor (drives wheels and cleans brushes).
- ** Battery **: Lithium-ion battery (long working time, efficient energy storage).
- ** Wheels **: Rubber wheels (provides traction and stability on various surfaces).
- ** Sensors **: Ultrasonic sensors and infrared sensors (for obstacle detection and automatic navigation).
- ** Control System **: Microcontroller (manages motor control, sensor input and motion).
- ** Dust collector **: container made of plastic or metal (for garbage collection).

## Method
1. ** Develop CAD models ** : Detail the dimensions of the self-cleaning vehicle and the layout of components such as brushes, motors, sensors and dust collection systems.
2. ** Material selection ** : Select lightweight and durable materials for frames and components, taking into account weight, cost and operational requirements.
3. ** Procurement ** : Select motors, sensors, batteries and other components that meet design specifications and ensure compatibility.
4. ** Microcontroller programming ** : For automatic control of movement, sensor input processing and path planning to ensure clean and efficient.
5. ** Assembly sequence planning ** : including the installation of the frame, the installation of the motor and sensor, the connection of the wire, and the testing of the components respectively.

## Manufacturing
1. Cut and weld aluminum alloy frame according to CAD model.
2. Install the brush and connect it to the motor shaft.
3. Install the gear motor that drives the wheels and connect it to the frame.
4. Install the dust collection container in an easily accessible location.
5. Install the control system, batteries and sensors to the frame, taking into account the ease of maintenance and wiring.
6. Connect the motor, sensor, and battery to the microcontroller. Ensure proper insulation and strong connections to prevent loose wiring during operation.
7. Test motion, sensor response, and brush rotation.
8. Calibrate sensor thresholds to detect obstacles and adjust motor speed for efficient cleaning.

### Verification
## Measurement
- ** Cleaning Efficiency ** : Measure the amount of garbage collected by the vacuum cleaner after a full cleaning cycle. Compare the weight or volume of garbage before and after cleaning to determine cleaning efficiency.
- ** Battery Performance ** : Measure total running time after full charge to verify battery performance and energy consumption.
- ** Sensor accuracy ** : Test the accuracy of ultrasonic and infrared sensors by placing various obstacles at different distances. Record the detection rate and any missed or error detection.
- ** Clean Coverage Area ** : Measure the clean coverage area to ensure that the car is traveling along a predetermined path without significant deviations or uncleaned areas.

### Analysis
- Use overlay diagrams to analyze the navigation path of the shopping cart. Identify overlapping or missing areas and improve path planning algorithms when needed.

### Verification
- Deploy automated cleaning vehicles on different types of stands, using different surface materials, garbage types and obstacles. Observe how it performs under real conditions and collect data for further analysis
